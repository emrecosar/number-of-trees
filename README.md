# number-of-trees
A programming assignment.

## Assignment

You are standing at the center(0,0) of a forest. Around you, there are many, many trees(x,y). By looking in which direction, when are
you able to see the most trees at the same time?

## Pre

* use existing forest.json or put your file to resources.
* no need to think about tree's tickness.
* you are just turning around.

## How-to

```./gradlew generateForest``` create a new forest

```./gradlew numberOfTrees``` to solve number-of-trees


### Output

```generateForest``` -> generate a forest with specified fine-name in the running directory.

```numberOfTrees```  -> print the center angle of field-of-view for your desired position.
